		<h1>Chapter One • Grace</h1>
		<h5> 15°F </h5>
		<section>
		<p>
			I remember lying in the snow, a small red spot of warm going cold, surrounded by wolves. They were licking
			<br>
			me, biting me, worrying at my body, pressing in. Their huddled bodies blocked what little heat the sun offered.
			<br>
			Ice glistened on their ruffs and their breath made opaque shapes that hung in the air around us. The musky smell
			<br>
			of their coats made me think of wet dog and burning leaves, pleasant and terrifying. Their tongues melted my
			<br>
			skin; their careless teeth ripped at my sleeves and snagged through my hair, pushed against my collarbone, the
			<br>
			pulse at my neck.
		</p>
		<p>
			I could have screamed, but I didn’t. I could have fought, but I didn’t. I just lay there and let it happen,
			<br>
			watching the winter-white sky go gray above me.
		</p>
		<p>
			One wolf prodded his nose into my hand and against my cheek, casting a shadow across my face. His yellow
			<br>
			eyes looked into mine while the other wolves jerked me this way and that.
		</p>
		<p>
			I held on to those eyes for as long as I could. Yellow. And, up close, flecked brilliantly with every shade of
			<br>
			gold and hazel. I didn’t want him to look away, and he didn’t. I wanted to reach out and grab a hold of his ruff,
			<br>
			but my hands stayed curled on my chest, my arms frozen to my body.
		</p>
		<p>
			I couldn’t remember what it felt like to be warm.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then he was gone, and without him, the other wolves closed in, too close, suffocating. Something seemed to
			<br>
			flutter in my chest.
		</p>
		<p>
			There was no sun; there was no light. I was dying. I couldn’t remember what the sky looked like.
			<br>
			But I didn’t die. I was lost to a sea of cold, and then I was reborn into a world of warmth.
			<br>
			I remember this: his yellow eyes.
			<br>
			I thought I’d never see them again.
